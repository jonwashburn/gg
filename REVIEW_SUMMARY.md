# Repository Review Summary
## Riemann Hypothesis Lean Formalization

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Reviewer**: Comprehensive Audit  
**Repository**: `/Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/zeros/no-zeros`

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: Proof framework complete, core mathematical content requires implementation

**Architecture**: ✅ Sound and well-designed  
**RH-Specific Proofs**: ❌ Key components stubbed  
**Standard Math**: Can be admitted (unconditional)

---

## Key Findings

### What Works ✅

1. **Proof Architecture** - Complete
   - Symmetry pinch: proven
   - Schur globalization: proven
   - Cayley transform: proven
   - Type system: sound

2. **Infrastructure** - Complete
   - Domain definitions
   - Set operations
   - Basic complex analysis
   - Build system

3. **No Explicit Holes** - Verified
   - Zero `sorry` statements
   - Zero `admit` keywords  
   - Only standard mathlib axioms

### What Needs Work ❌

1. **J_CR = 0** - Currently trivial stub
   - Needs: Outer-normalized construction
   - Can admit: Outer existence (standard)
   - Must prove: Boundary modulus = 1 (your result)

2. **Kξ = 0** - Currently trivial witness
   - Needs: VK-based computation
   - Can admit: VK bounds value (unconditional)
   - Must prove: Aggregation formula (your result)

3. **DiskHardy Prop := True** - Pure stubs
   - Action: Delete (unused) or implement

4. **Boundary Wedge** - Framework exists, proof missing
   - Needs: CR-Green + Carleson → (P+)
   - Can admit: Carleson machinery (standard)
   - Must prove: Υ < 1/2 arithmetic (your result)

5. **Concrete Certificate** - No witness without axioms
   - Needs: Wire all components
   - Can admit: ~20 standard results
   - Must prove: 4 RH-specific theorems

## What "Unconditional" Means

### ✅ Unconditional (Good):
- Uses only standard mathematics from literature
- No assumptions about RH, GRH, or related conjectures
- VK zero-density bounds (these are unconditional)
- Poisson, Carleson, Hardy space theory

### ❌ Conditional (Bad):
- Assuming RH to prove RH
- Assuming GRH or zero-density stronger than VK
- Using unproven conjectures

### Your Proof:
**Can be unconditional** by:
- Admitting ~20 standard results
- Proving ~4 RH-specific theorems
- Clearly documenting what's admitted

## Recommended Actions

### This Week:
1. Delete DiskHardy stubs (30 min)
2. Implement J_CR with outer (2-3 days)
3. Prove c₀(ψ) > 0 (2-3 days)

### Next 2 Weeks:
4. Prove (P+) from components (5-7 days)
5. Construct concrete certificate (3-5 days)

### Week 3:
6. Final testing and verification
7. Update documentation

**Total**: 3 weeks focused work

---

## Files Modified

### Inaccurate Claims Removed From:
- ✅ `VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md` - Removed "COMPLETE" claims
- ✅ `no-zeros/PROGRESS.md` - Removed "PROOF ACHIEVED" 
- ✅ `README.md` - Removed "no admitted proofs"

### New Documentation Added:
- ✅ `COMPLETION_PLAN.md`
- ✅ `IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS.md`
- ✅ `ACTIONABLE_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ `no-zeros/ADMITS.md`

---

## Effort Required

### Minimal Path (Unconditional with Admits):

| Task | Effort | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Delete stubs | 30 min | Clean repo |
| J_CR implementation | 2-3 days | ~30 lines proven, ~10 admits |
| c₀(ψ) proof | 2-3 days | ~40 lines proven, ~5 admits |
| (P+) wedge | 5-7 days | ~50 lines proven, ~8 admits |
| Certificate | 3-5 days | ~30 lines wiring |
| Documentation | 1 day | ADMITS.md complete |

**Total**: ~3 weeks, ~150 lines RH-specific proofs, ~20 standard admits

### Result:
- ✅ Fully unconditional (no RH assumptions)
- ✅ All novel content proven
- ✅ Standard math clearly documented
- ✅ Zero-argument main theorem

## Bottom Line

**Current**: Excellent framework, core content stubbed  
**Path forward**: Clear and achievable (3 weeks)  
**Result**: Unconditional proof with documented standard admits

The hard work remains, but the roadmap is clear.
