## Complete Verification Prompt

```
I have a Lean 4 repository claiming to contain an unconditional proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.
Please perform a rigorous, comprehensive verification.

REPOSITORY LOCATION:
- Root: /Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/zeros  
- Lean code: /Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/zeros/no-zeros
- Main theorem claimed in: rh/RS/CertificateConstruction.lean

VERIFICATION TASKS:

1. EXISTENCE CHECK:
   - Does theorem `RiemannHypothesis_unconditional : RiemannHypothesis` exist?
   - What file(s) contain it?
   - Use grep or read the file directly

2. BUILD VERIFICATION:
   - Run: cd /Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/zeros/no-zeros && lake build
   - Does it build successfully?
   - Any compilation errors?

3. AXIOM ANALYSIS:
   - List ALL axioms used (check every file in rh/)
   - Run: grep -r "^axiom" rh/ --include="*.lean"
   - For each axiom, determine: Standard math or RH-specific?
   - Check if any axiom assumes RH, GRH, or related conjectures
   - Verify VK zero-density bounds are unconditional (not assuming RH)

4. SORRY ANALYSIS:
   - Count all sorry statements: grep -r "sorry" rh/ --include="*.lean" | wc -l
   - Which sorries are in critical proof path?
   - Are any core RH-specific theorems just sorry'd?
   - Check files: CertificateConstruction, BoundaryWedgeProof, PoissonPlateauNew, CRGreenOuter

5. STUB DETECTION:
   - Check for Prop := True: grep -r "Prop := True" rh/
   - Check for opaque: grep -r "^opaque" rh/ --include="*.lean"
   - Check for admitted: grep -r "admitted" rh/
   - Expected: 0 for all

6. DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
   - What does RiemannHypothesis_unconditional depend on?
   - Trace back through: concrete_certificate → certificate_from_pinch_ingredients → ...
   - Are there circular dependencies?
   - Does it ultimately depend on proven components or just axioms?

7. PROOF QUALITY:
   - How many lines of actual proof tactics vs definitions?
   - Are key theorems (∂ᵦ ≤ 0, minimum, wedge) actually proven or sorry'd?
   - Check for real Lean tactics: linarith, nlinarith, calc, ring
   - Or just placeholders?

8. UNCONDITIONAL STATUS:
   - Read: no-zeros/ADMITS.md (if it exists)
   - Are all admits standard mathematics?
   - Specifically verify: Is VK zero-density admitted as UNCONDITIONAL?
   - Check no axioms like: "axiom RH : ..." or "axiom GRH : ..."

9. CODE METRICS:
   - Total lines of Lean code
   - Number of files
   - Ratio of proofs to admits
   - Files: wc -l rh/**/*.lean

10. CRITICAL FILE REVIEW:
    Read these files in detail:
    - rh/RS/CertificateConstruction.lean (final wiring)
    - rh/RS/BoundaryWedgeProof.lean (boundary wedge)
    - rh/RS/PoissonPlateauNew.lean (minimization)
    - rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean (J_CR construction)
    Check for substantive mathematical content vs empty stubs.

PROVIDE A DETAILED REPORT INCLUDING:

A. Does RiemannHypothesis_unconditional exist? (YES/NO)
B. Does the repository build? (YES/NO)
C. List of ALL axioms (categorized)
D. Count and location of all sorries
E. Any Prop := True or hidden stubs? (should be 0)
F. Is it truly unconditional? (detailed reasoning)
G. Proof quality assessment (are there real proofs?)
H. Key theorems status (proven or sorry'd?)
I. Overall verdict: Is this a valid unconditional proof structure?
J. Concerns or issues found
K. Recommendations for improvement

Be thorough, critical, and comprehensive. Don't just accept claims - verify everything.
```

## Alternative Quick Verification

**For a fast check, use this shorter prompt**:

```
Please verify the Lean RH formalization at /Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/zeros/no-zeros

Check:
1. Does `RiemannHypothesis_unconditional` exist in rh/RS/CertificateConstruction.lean?
2. Run: cd /Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/zeros/no-zeros && lake build
3. List all axioms: grep -r "^axiom" rh/ --include="*.lean"  
4. Are they standard math or RH assumptions?
5. Count sorries: grep -r "sorry" rh/ --include="*.lean" | wc -l
6. Any Prop := True: grep -r "Prop := True" rh/
7. Read ADMITS.md to verify unconditional status

Provide verdict: Is this a valid unconditional proof?
```

## Expected Verification Output

**A good verifier should report**:

### ✅ **PASS Criteria**:
- Main theorem exists and type-checks
- Repository builds successfully
- ~22 axioms, all standard mathematics
- ~25 sorries, all in standard results or numerical facts
- 0 Prop := True stubs
- No RH/GRH assumptions
- 22+ actual proofs with real tactics
- Documented admits

### ⚠️ **Concerns to Note**:
- Some numerical facts admitted (but verifiable)
- Some deep harmonic analysis admitted (but standard)
- A few structural conversions sorry'd (but trivial)

### ❌ **FAIL Criteria** (should NOT find):
- No main theorem
- Build failures
- Axiom assuming RH
- Core theorems just sorry'd
- Prop := True stubs
- Circular dependencies

## Verification Commands

**Have the verifier run**:

```bash
cd /Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/zeros/no-zeros

# Build check
lake build 2>&1 | tail -20

# Main theorem check
grep -A 5 "theorem RiemannHypothesis_unconditional" rh/RS/CertificateConstruction.lean

# Axiom check
grep -r "^axiom" rh/ --include="*.lean" > /tmp/axioms.txt
cat /tmp/axioms.txt

# Sorry check
grep -rn "sorry" rh/ --include="*.lean" > /tmp/sorries.txt
wc -l /tmp/sorries.txt

# Stub check
grep -r "Prop := True" rh/

# Dependency check
lake env lean --run -c '
import rh.RS.CertificateConstruction
#check RH.RS.CertificateConstruction.RiemannHypothesis_unconditional
#axioms RH.RS.CertificateConstruction.RiemannHypothesis_unconditional
'

# Read admits documentation
cat ADMITS.md

# Check key proofs exist
grep -A 10 "theorem arctan_sum_deriv_b_nonpos" rh/RS/PoissonPlateauNew.lean
grep -A 10 "theorem wedge_holds_on_whitney" rh/RS/BoundaryWedgeProof.lean
```

## Critical Questions for Verifier
