# Session Summary

## Axioms Eliminated: 2 (Real Work)

1. **arctan_le_pi_div_two**: Reduced to `Real.arctan_lt_pi_div_two` from mathlib
2. **pi_gt_314**: Reduced to `Real.pi_gt_d2` from mathlib

Both required finding actual mathlib lemmas and proving the connection.

## Blockers Hit: 3

1. **blocker-1**: BoundaryModulusEq type mismatch for outer_exists
2. **blocker-3**: poisson_transport_interior needs HasPoissonRep for J_canonical (doesn't exist)
3. **axiom-4**: arctan(2) > 1.1 - norm_num couldn't evaluate

## Current State

Axioms: 44 (down from 46)
Build: passing
Commit: 5118401

## Next Actions

Try simpler mathlib reductions or tackle blocker-1 (type compatibility).
