## 🎯 Next Item

**ACTION 3.5.2-3.5.4**: Minimization Calculus (1-2 days)

**Cannot complete in one session** - requires dedicated calculus work

**Decomposed** in `ACTION_3.5_DECOMPOSITION.md`:
- Sub-Task 3.5.2: ∂ₓ ≤ 0 (half day)
- Sub-Task 3.5.3: ∂ᵦ ≤ 0 (half day)
- Sub-Task 3.5.4: Minimum at (1,1) (3 hours)

**File**: `PoissonPlateauNew.lean` lines 268, 274, 280
