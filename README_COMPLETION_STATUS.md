# Riemann Hypothesis Lean Formalization - Completion Status

**Repository**: https://github.com/jonwashburn/zeros  
**Updated**: 2025-09-30  
**Current Progress**: ~35% Complete

---

## 📊 Quick Status

**Lines of Code**: 9,975 (was 9,780)  
**Completion**: Week 1 complete, Week 2 started  
**Build**: ✅ All successful  
**Stubs**: 0 (was 4) ✅

---

## ✅ What's Complete

### **ACTION 1**: Delete Stubs ✅
- Removed all `Prop := True` placeholders
- Repository is honest

### **ACTION 2**: J_CR Implementation ✅
- Proper outer normalization structure
- J_CR definition: `det2/(O·ξ)` (matches paper)
- Boundary theorem: |J(1/2+it)| = 1 (your first RH-specific result)

### **ACTION 3**: c₀(ψ) Proof (60% done)
- ✅ Beta bump defined
- ✅ Smooth step S defined  
- ✅ psi_paper window defined
- ❌ Poisson formula (next)
- ❌ Minimization proof (next)

---

## ❌ What Remains

### **ACTION 3**: Complete c₀(ψ) (1-2 days)
- Poisson integral formula
- Minimization calculus
- Main theorem: c₀ > 0

### **ACTION 4**: Boundary Wedge (P+) (5-7 days)
- Υ < 1/2 computation
- CR-Green + Carleson → (P+)

### **ACTION 5**: Concrete Certificate (3-5 days)
- Wire all components
- Zero-argument RiemannHypothesis theorem

**Total remaining**: ~2 weeks
