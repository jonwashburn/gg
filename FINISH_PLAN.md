- Line 280: Prove or admit Poisson monotonicity (standard)
- Lines 455, 516: Prove derivative symmetry (should be doable)

**File:** `no-zeros/rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean`  
**Lines:** 118, 121

**What to do:**

**Estimated:** 0.5 days (documentation + clean admits)

#### Task 2.2: Outer Uniqueness
**File:** `no-zeros/rh/RS/CertificateConstruction.lean`  
**Line:** 97

### Phase 3: Main Wedge Theorem (5-7 days)

**Goal:** Complete the Whitney wedge → (P+) theorem.

#### Task 3.1: Phase Velocity Identity
**File:** `no-zeros/rh/RS/BoundaryWedgeProof.lean`  
**Context:** Line 292 axiom, ties to PoissonPlateauNew.lean work

**What to do:**
- This is the c₀(ψ) minimization computation

**What to do:**
- Assemble: CR-Green + Carleson + Poisson + phase velocity → (P+)
- This is the main theorem of the wedge section
- Wire together all the components from axioms and Phase 1 work
- Cannot admit - this is novel proof-specific work

**Estimated:** 3-4 days

#### Task 3.3: Numerical Bound
**File:** `no-zeros/rh/RS/BoundaryWedgeProof.lean`  
**Line:** 116

**What to do:**

## Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Computations)
    ├─→ Task 1.1: Poisson computations
    ├─→ Task 1.2: Symmetry cases  
    └─→ Task 1.3: CR-Green details
         ↓
Phase 2 (Admits) - Can run in parallel with Phase 1
    ├─→ Task 2.1: Boundary facts
    └─→ Task 2.2: Outer uniqueness
         ↓
Phase 3 (Main Theorem) - Requires Phase 1 complete
    ├─→ Task 3.1: Phase velocity ← depends on Task 1.1, 1.2
    ├─→ Task 3.2: Wedge assembly ← depends on Task 3.1, all axioms
    └─→ Task 3.3: Numerical bound
```

## Success Criteria

After completion, the proof should satisfy:

1. ✅ **Zero sorries** in active proof chain
2. ✅ **All axioms documented** with literature citations
3. ✅ **Concrete certificate exists**: Can construct `C : PinchCertificateExt`
4. ✅ **Main theorem closes**: `theorem RiemannHypothesis : RiemannHypothesis`
5. ✅ **Build succeeds**: `lake build` with no errors
6. ✅ **Axiom check clean**: Only Mathlib axioms (propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound)

## Work Strategy

### Recommended Order

**Week 1** (Days 1-3):
- Day 1: Phase 1, Task 1.1 (Poisson computations)
- Day 2: Phase 1, Tasks 1.2 + 1.3 (Symmetry + CR-Green)
- Day 3: Phase 2, all tasks (Admits documentation)

**Week 2** (Days 4-8):
- Days 4-5: Phase 3, Task 3.1 (Phase velocity)
- Days 6-8: Phase 3, Task 3.2 (Main wedge)
- Day 8: Phase 3, Task 3.3 + final verification

### Alternative: Parallel Track
- One person on Phase 1 + 2 (computations)
- Another on Phase 3 scaffolding
- Merge when Phase 1 complete

## Notes

### What Makes This "Unconditional"?

The proof is unconditional because:
- ✅ No axioms assume RH or related conjectures
- ✅ All admits are for standard mathematics (Hardy, Carleson, Poisson)
- ✅ VK zero-density (axiom in BoundaryWedgeProof) is unconditional (Ivić Thm 13.30)
- ✅ Novel RH-specific content (Phase velocity, wedge assembly) will be proven

### What Cannot Be Admitted?

These are novel to this proof and must be proven:
- ❌ Phase velocity identity (c₀ minimization)
- ❌ Main wedge theorem (line 371)
- ❌ Certificate construction wiring

Everything else can be admitted with proper citations to literature.
