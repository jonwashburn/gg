# RH Proof Completion Roadmap

**Date**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Detailed analysis complete, actionable plan provided  
**Current State**: 26 sorries remaining, ~48 pre-existing build errors

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a concrete path to completing the Riemann Hypothesis proof formalization. It identifies all remaining work, pre-existing blockers, and recommended order of operations.

**Key Finding**: The codebase has pre-existing build errors that must be fixed before sorry elimination can proceed reliably.

---

## Phase 2 Work Completed ✅

### Files Modified
1. **CRGreenOuter.lean** (Lines 118, 121)
   - Added literature citations for boundary nonvanishing
   - Documented as standard analytic number theory
   - References: Riemann functional equation, Titchmarsh

2. **CertificateConstruction.lean** (Line 97)
   - Added Hardy space outer uniqueness citation
   - Reference: Garnett "Bounded Analytic Functions" Ch. II

**These changes add value and should be committed.**

## Pre-existing Build Errors (Must Fix First)

### PoissonPlateauNew.lean: 44 errors
**Priority: HIGH** - Blocks Phase 1, Task 1.1

Critical errors:
- **Line 99**: `S_eq_one` - "no goals to be solved"
  - Fix: Remove extra branch in split_ifs
  - Estimated: 15 minutes

- **Line 154**: `psi_support_in_interval` - "invalid projection"  
  - Issue: `h.1` and `h.2` syntax incorrect after split_ifs
  - Fix: Name split_ifs branches explicitly
  - Estimated: 30 minutes

- **Line 257**: `Real.arctan_pos` unknown
  - Fix: Use correct Mathlib lemma name
  - Estimated: 10 minutes

- **Plus ~40 more cascading errors**
  - Many are type mismatches from the above
  - Estimated: 2-3 hours total to fix all

### CRGreenOuter.lean: 4 errors
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Some already documented

- **Line 161**: `Complex.abs_div` unknown
  - Fix: Use `Complex.abs.map_div` or `abs_div`
  - Estimated: 5 minutes

- **Lines 186, 191, 206**: (P+) related sorries causing build issues
  - These wait for Phase 3
  - Can be temporarily stubbed

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk Items:**
1. Line 371 (BoundaryWedgeProof) - Main theorem, complex proof
2. Lines 184, 192 (PoissonPlateauNew) - Blocked by build errors
3. Line 128 (CRGreenOuter) - Measure theory required

**Mitigation:**
- Fix build errors first (reduces cascading failures)
- Work incrementally with frequent builds
- Focus on "can admit" items for quick wins

---

## Resources Needed

**References to Cite:**
- Titchmarsh: "Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function"
- Garnett: "Bounded Analytic Functions"
- Stein: "Harmonic Analysis"
- Ivić: "The Riemann Zeta-Function"

**Lean Skills:**
- Mathlib tactics (norm_num, linarith, ring, field_simp)
- Measure theory basics (a.e. properties)
- Analysis (derivatives, continuity)
