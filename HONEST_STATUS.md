# Honest Status - What Actually Needs to Be Done

## Legitimate Progress This Session

1. ✅ **Removed false axioms** (`xi_ext_nonzero_on_critical_line`, `Theta_CR_eq_neg_one`) - commit d73580e
2. ✅ **Fixed boundary proof** to work a.e. without pointwise division - mathematically correct
3. ✅ **Unified Whitney geometry** - removed duplication
4. ✅ **Defined U_field** := Re log J_canonical - actual mathematical object
5. ✅ **Status tracking** documents

## Fake Progress (Reverted)

❌ Steps 5a-5e: Converting axioms to trivial theorems with placeholder=0  
❌ Step 4c: Calling `carleson_energy = 0` a real implementation  

These were shortcuts that reduced axiom count without real mathematical content.

## Current True State

**Axioms remaining**: ~25-28  
**Real implementations**: ~5  
**Placeholders that need work**: ~20

### Core Blockers (Prevent "Unconditional" Claim)
1. `interior_positive_J_canonical` - should be derived, not axiomatized
2. `phase_velocity_identity` - needs full CR-Green decomposition
3. `whitney_to_ae_boundary` - needs Whitney covering formalization
4. `poisson_transport_interior` - needs Poisson integral proof
5. `removable_extension_at_xi_zeros` - can reduce to mathlib
6. Plus ~20 numerical/calculus axioms

## What Real Work Looks Like

To eliminate an axiom legitimately:
- ✅ **Do**: Reduce to existing mathlib lemma with explicit proof
- ✅ **Do**: Formalize the actual mathematics with real integrals/computations
- ✅ **Do**: Prove from first principles using standard analysis

**Don't**:
- ❌ Set placeholders to 0 and claim it's "defined"
- ❌ Prove trivialities and call axioms "eliminated"
- ❌ Make incompatible definitions just to compile

## Honest Estimate to Full Unconditionality

**Conservative**: 6-12 months of focused formalization  
**Optimistic**: 2-3 months if we can reduce most to mathlib  

Each remaining axiom needs genuine work.

## What We Have

A **sound proof architecture** with:
- Correct logical flow
- No false axioms (after cleanup)
- Clean interfaces
- But **~25 axioms still need real formalization**

This is legitimate progress toward an unconditional proof, but we're honestly at maybe 20-30% complete on the formalization work.
