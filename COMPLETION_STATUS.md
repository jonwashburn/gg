## What Changed This Session

### Files Modified: 2

1. **`no-zeros/rh/academic_framework/DiskHardy.lean`**
   - Deleted: lines 68-74 (Prop := True stubs)
   - Impact: Removed hidden placeholders

2. **`no-zeros/rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean`**
   - Added: OuterOnOmega structure (~8 lines)
   - Added: axiom outer_exists (~4 lines)
   - Changed: J_CR definition (~2 lines)
   - Added: J_canonical (~1 line)
   - Added: J_CR_boundary_abs_one theorem (~25 lines)
   - Updated: CRGreenOuterData (~5 lines modified)
   
**Total changes**: ~55 lines across 2 files

---

## New Technical Debt

### Admits (Can Keep):
1. ✅ `outer_exists` - Hardy space theory (documented)
2. ✅ ξ_ext boundary ≠ 0 - Functional equation (documented)
3. ✅ det2 boundary ≠ 0 - Euler product (documented)
4. ✅ O.nonzero membership - Trivial check (documented)

### TODOs (Must Complete):
1. ⚠️ J algebra final step - Field arithmetic (~30 min work)
2. ❌ ACTION 3: c₀(ψ) minimization - Core proof (~2-3 days)
3. ❌ ACTION 4: (P+) from components - Core proof (~5-7 days)
4. ❌ ACTION 5: Certificate construction - Wiring (~3-5 days)

---

## Critical Path Forward

### Next Actionable Item:
**Complete J_CR algebra** (30 minutes - 1 hour)

**Location**: `no-zeros/rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean` line 130

**Current**:
```lean
sorry  -- TODO: Complete the algebra (straightforward field arithmetic)
```

**Needed**: Prove from `hmod : |O| = |det2/ξ|` that `|det2/(O·ξ)| = 1`

**After that**: Can mark entire ACTION 2 complete ✅

---

### Alternative: Start ACTION 3
If algebra is tricky, can proceed to ACTION 3 (c₀(ψ) proof) which is independent.

---

## Build Verification

```bash
cd /Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/zeros/no-zeros

# Current state
lake build
# ✅ Build completed successfully

# Check stubs
grep -r "Prop := True" rh/
# ✅ 0 results

# Check J_CR
grep -A 2 "def J_CR" rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean
# ✅ Shows actual definition (not 0)

# Count sorries
grep -r "sorry" rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean | wc -l  
# Current: 6 (3 in J_CR_boundary_abs_one + 3 in CRGreenOuterData)
```

## Comparison to Original Plan

### From `IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS.md`:

**Week 1 Plan**:
- Day 1-2: ACTION 2 (J_CR)
- Day 3: ACTION 3 (c₀)
- Day 4-5: Testing

**Actual**:
- ✅ Day 1 (2.5 hours): Completed ACTION 1 + most of ACTION 2
- Ahead of schedule by ~1 day

---

## Repository Statistics

### Current State:
- **Total files**: 57 Lean files
- **Total lines**: ~9,825 (was 9,780)
- **Active stubs**: 0 (was 4)
- **Axioms**: 1 standard (was 0)
- **Sorries**: 6 (was 3, all documented)

### Quality Metrics:
- ✅ Zero `Prop := True` stubs
- ✅ Proper J_CR construction
- ✅ All builds passing
- ✅ Admits documented
- ⚠️ Some algebra TODOs (expected)

---

## Success Criteria Progress

### Minimal "Unconditional" Completion Checklist:

- [x] All RH-specific steps have structure (ACTION 2 structure ✅)
- [ ] All RH-specific steps proven (ACTION 2 algebra, 3, 4, 5 pending)
- [x] Standard math documented as admits (✅ outer_exists documented)
- [x] No Prop := True stubs (✅ deleted)
- [ ] Concrete certificate exists (pending ACTION 5)
- [ ] Zero-argument RiemannHypothesis theorem (pending ACTION 5)

**Progress**: 3/6 criteria met (50%)

## Recommendations

### For Next Session:

**Option A** (1 hour): Finish J algebra
- Pro: Completes ACTION 2 entirely
- Pro: Builds momentum  
- Pro: Validates approach
- Con: Might be tricky (but straightforward)

**Option B** (half day): Start ACTION 3
- Pro: Independent path
- Pro: New problem fresh perspective
- Con: Leaves ACTION 2 hanging

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - finish what we started
