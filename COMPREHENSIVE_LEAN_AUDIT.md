# Comprehensive Lean Formalization Audit
## Riemann Hypothesis Proof - Repository: `/no-zeros`

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Auditor**: AI Assistant  
**Goal**: Fully unconditional proof within Mathlib (no axioms beyond classical, no sorries, no admits)

---

## Executive Summary

⚠️ **CRITICAL FINDINGS**: The proof is **INCOMPLETE**. While the proof architecture is well-structured and there are no explicit `sorry` or `admit` statements, there are **FUNDAMENTAL GAPS** in the proof chain.

### Status: 🔴 **INCOMPLETE - REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT WORK**

---

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Hidden Prop Placeholders** 🔴 BLOCKER
**Location**: `no-zeros/rh/academic_framework/DiskHardy.lean`

```lean
Lines 68-74:
def PPlusOnCircle (F : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop := True
def DiskPoissonTransport (F : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop := True  
def ExistsDiskOuterWithBoundaryModulus (F : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop := True
```

**Impact**: These are pure stubs that would make any theorem using them trivially true.  
**Fix Required**: Remove these or implement proper definitions.

---

### 2. **Trivial J_CR Implementation** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Location**: `no-zeros/rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean`

```lean
Lines 77-91:
/-- CR–Green outer J (trivial constant model): define `J ≡ 0`. -/
def J_CR (_s : ℂ) : ℂ := 0

/-- OuterData built from the CR–Green outer `J_CR` via `F := 2·J`. -/
def CRGreenOuterData : OuterData :=
{ F := fun s => (2 : ℂ) * J_CR s
, hRe := by intro _z _hz; simp [J_CR]
, hDen := by intro _z _hz; simp [J_CR] }
```

**Analysis**: 
- `J_CR` is defined as the constant function `0`
- This means `CRGreenOuterData.F` is also `0`
- The Cayley transform becomes `Θ_CR = (0-1)/(0+1) = -1` (constant)
- **This is a placeholder, not the actual CR-Green outer function**

**Impact**: The entire proof chain relies on `CRGreenOuterData`, but it's using a trivial stub instead of the actual boundary integral/CR-Green construction described in the paper.

---

### 3. **Incomplete Certificate Chain** 🔴 CRITICAL

The proof requires a `PinchCertificateExt` witness, which needs:

1. ✅ **Symmetry argument** - Complete in `Main.lean:96-123`
2. ❌ **CR-Green boundary integral** - Stub (J_CR = 0)  
3. ❌ **Actual Poisson transport** - Not proven, only interface
4. ❌ **Kξ Whitney bound** - Only interface stubs, no actual proof
5. ✅ **Schur globalization** - Complete
6. ✅ **Removable singularity** - Complete

**Current State**: The main theorem `RH` requires:
```lean
theorem RH (C : RH.RS.PinchCertificateExt) : RiemannHypothesis
```

But there is **no actual construction of a concrete `PinchCertificateExt` witness** that doesn't rely on stubs.

---

### 4. **Kξ Whitney Bounds - Interface Only** 🟡 INCOMPLETE

**Location**: `no-zeros/rh/Cert/KxiWhitney_RvM.lean`

```lean
Lines 61-69:
theorem rvM_short_interval_bound_energy
  (ZCount : ℝ → ℕ) (c A0 A1 T0 : ℝ)
  (_h : rvM_short_interval_bound ZCount c A0 A1 T0) :
  ∃ Kξ : ℝ, 0 ≤ Kξ ∧ ConcreteHalfPlaneCarleson Kξ := by
  -- Interface witness: choose `Kξ = 0`
  refine ⟨0, by simp, ?_⟩
  refine And.intro (by simp) ?_
  intro W
  simp [mkWhitneyBoxEnergy]
```

**Analysis**: Returns `Kξ = 0` as a trivial witness. This is just an interface placeholder.

---

### 5. **Certificate Readiness** 🟡 NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Location**: `no-zeros/rh/academic_framework/Certificate.lean`

The certificate claims to be ready:
```lean
theorem Ready_unconditional : Ready := by
  refine Ready_of_factors ?hK0 ?hFac ?hCert
  · exact RH.Cert.K0Available_proved
  · exact RH.Cert.kxiWitness_nonempty
  · exact (RH.Cert.kxiWitness_nonempty : RH.Cert.CertificateReady)
```

But this relies on `kxiWitness_nonempty` which may be a trivial witness.

---

## Path to Completion

### Priority 1: Replace Trivial J_CR 🔴 CRITICAL

**File**: `no-zeros/rh/RS/CRGreenOuter.lean`

**What's needed**:
```lean
-- Replace this:
def J_CR (_s : ℂ) : ℂ := 0

-- With actual CR-Green boundary integral construction
def J_CR (s : ℂ) : ℂ := 
  -- Outer-normalized ratio: det2(s) / (O(s) * ξ(s))
  -- where O is constructed from boundary modulus
  sorry
```

**Dependencies**:
- Outer function construction from boundary modulus
- Boundary integral machinery
- Phase-velocity identity

---

### Priority 2: Remove DiskHardy Stubs 🔴 BLOCKER

**File**: `no-zeros/rh/academic_framework/DiskHardy.lean`

**Action**: Either:
1. Delete lines 68-74 completely if unused, OR
2. Implement proper definitions

---

### Priority 3: Implement Kξ Whitney Bound 🟡 HIGH

**File**: `no-zeros/rh/Cert/KxiWhitney_RvM.lean`

**What's needed**:
- Actual short-interval zero count bound
- Carleson energy aggregation
- Non-trivial `Kξ` value

---

### Priority 4: Boundary Wedge (P+) 🟡 HIGH

**Files**: 
- `no-zeros/rh/RS/BoundaryWedge.lean`
- `no-zeros/rh/RS/PPlusFromCarleson.lean`

**What's needed**:
- CR-Green pairing with actual J
- Carleson energy bound
- Wedge closure: `∫ ψ(-W') ≤ π·Upsilon` with `Upsilon < 1/2`

---

### Priority 5: Concrete Certificate 🟡 HIGH

**What's needed**:
A theorem of the form:
```lean
theorem concrete_pinch_certificate : RH.RS.PinchCertificateExt := by
  -- Construct actual witness using:
  -- 1. Outer from boundary modulus
  -- 2. J from CR-Green
  -- 3. Interior positivity from Poisson + (P+)
  -- 4. Removable extension from u-trick
  sorry
```

Then instantiate:
```lean
theorem RiemannHypothesis : RiemannHypothesis := 
  RH concrete_pinch_certificate
```

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (1-3 days)

1. **Remove DiskHardy stubs** (1 hour)
   - Delete or implement lines 68-74
   
2. **Document stub status** (2 hours)
   - Add clear comments marking `J_CR = 0` as placeholder
   - Document what's needed for completion

3. **Create stub-free test** (3 hours)
   - Add verification that catches `Prop := True` patterns
   - Ensure CI fails on stubs

### Medium Term (1-2 weeks)

4. **Implement CR-Green J** (3-5 days)
   - Outer construction from boundary modulus
   - Boundary integral pairing
   - Phase derivative identity

5. **Implement Kξ bound** (2-3 days)
   - Whitney-scale zero counts
   - Carleson energy aggregation

6. **Prove (P+)** (2-3 days)
   - CR-Green + Carleson → wedge
   - Wedge closure

### Long Term (2-4 weeks)

7. **Complete certificate chain** (1 week)
   - Wire all components together
   - Construct concrete witness

8. **Final verification** (3-5 days)
   - Full build with no stubs
   - Axiom check
   - Independent review

---

## Current Build Status

**Last Check**: 2025-09-30

```bash
cd /Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/zeros/no-zeros
lake build
```

**Result**: ⚠️ Builds successfully but with **fundamental incompleteness**

The build succeeds because:
- Stubs are well-typed
- No explicit `sorry` statements
- Architecture is sound

But the proof is **not actually complete** because core components are trivial placeholders.

## Comparison to Paper

### Paper Claims (Riemann-lean-verified.tex)

The paper states:
> "Lean formalization (commit 9cb1780). A mathlib-only Lean 4 formalization, with no axioms and no admitted proofs"

### Reality

1. ✅ No explicit `sorry` or `admit` 
2. ✅ Only mathlib axioms
3. ❌ **Core proof steps are stubs** (J_CR = 0, Kξ = 0, Prop := True)
4. ❌ **No concrete certificate witness**

**Conclusion**: The paper's claim is **misleading**. While there are no explicit admits, the proof relies on trivial stubs that make the theorem vacuous.

---

## Estimated Completion Time

**Conservative Estimate**: 4-6 weeks of focused work

**Breakdown**:
- Week 1: CR-Green J implementation
- Week 2: Kξ Whitney bound + (P+)  
- Week 3: Certificate construction
- Week 4: Testing + verification

**Required Expertise**:
- Complex analysis (Hardy spaces, Poisson integral)
- Analytic number theory (zero-density estimates)
- Lean 4 formalization
- Carleson measures / BMO theory

---

## Action Items

### For Repository Owner

1. ⚠️ **Update VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md** - Current claims are inaccurate
2. ⚠️ **Add INCOMPLETE flag** - Mark repo as work-in-progress
3. ✅ **Remove hidden stubs** - Delete DiskHardy Prop := True
4. ✅ **Document gaps** - List what's missing clearly
5. ✅ **Create issues** - Track each missing component

### For Future Work

1. Implement CR-Green J (Priority 1)
2. Implement Kξ bound (Priority 2)
3. Prove (P+) (Priority 3)
4. Construct concrete certificate (Priority 4)
5. Final integration test (Priority 5)

---

## Conclusion

**The Lean formalization is NOT complete.** While the architecture is sound and there are no explicit holes, **critical components are trivial stubs**:

1. `J_CR = 0` instead of actual CR-Green outer
2. `Kξ = 0` instead of actual Carleson bound  
3. `Prop := True` placeholders in DiskHardy
4. No concrete `PinchCertificateExt` witness

**To achieve a fully unconditional proof**, these must be replaced with actual implementations. The current state is a well-structured **proof framework** awaiting the hard analysis to fill in the gaps.

**Estimated effort to completion**: 4-6 weeks for someone with appropriate expertise.
